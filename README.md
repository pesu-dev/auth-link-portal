This is a website that handles verification of the students joining PESU Discord Server, by authenticating them using Discord OAuth thus providing access to the rest of the server. This project is currently, actively maintained and updated.

The application is built with security and privacy in mind, ensuring safe and effective community management while maintaining user confidentiality.
